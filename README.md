#### Contributions:
For each member, list which of the following sections they worked on, and summarize the contributions in 1-2 sentences. Be specific!

- **A**: Project Idea
- **B**: Dataset Curation and Preprocessing
- **C**: Data Exploration and Summary Statistics
- **D**: ML Algorithm Design/Development
- **E**: ML Algorithm Training and Test Data Analysis
- **F**: Visualization, Result Analysis, Conclusion
- **G**: Final Tutorial Report Creation
- **H**: Additional (not listed above)

### 3. Introduction
The introduction should motivate your work:  
- What is your topic?  
- What question(s) are you trying to answer with your analysis?  
- Why is answering those questions important?

---

### 4. Data Curation
- Cite the source(s) of your data.
- Explain what the data is.
- Transform the data so that it is ready for analysis.  
  For example, you might set up a database and use SQL to query for data, or organize a pandas DataFrame.

---

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis
(See checkpoint 2.)

---

### 6. Primary Analysis
- Based on the results of your exploration, choose a machine learning technique (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, etc.) that will help you answer the questions you posed in the introduction.
- Explain your reasoning for choosing the technique.

---

### 7. Visualization
- Explain the results and insights of your primary analysis with at least one plot.
- Make sure that every element of the plots are labeled and explained (donâ€™t forget to include a legend!).

---

### 8. Insights and Conclusions
- After reading through the project, does an uninformed reader feel informed about the topic?  
- Would a reader who already knew about the topic feel like they learned more about it?

---

### 9. (Optional) Additional Sections
If needed, you may add subsections as appropriate for your project.
