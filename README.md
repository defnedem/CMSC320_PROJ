# CMSC320 FINAL PROJECT
The format of the final tutorial (final deliverable) should be as follows:
# Title
## Contributors
Contributions:
For each member, list which of the following sections they worked on, and
summarize the contributions in 1-2 sentences. Be specific!
A: Project idea
B: Dataset Curation and Preprocessing
C: Data Exploration and Summary Statistics
D: ML Algorithm Design/Development
E: ML Algorithm Training and Test Data Analysis
F: Visualization, Result Analysis, Conclusion
G: Final Tutorial Report Creation
H: Additional (not listed above)
2. Introduction. The introduction should motivate your work: what is your topic? What
question(s) are you trying to answer with your analysis? Why is answering those
questions important?
3. Data curation. Cite the source(s) of your data. Explain what it is. Transform the data
so that it is ready for analysis. For example, set up a database and use SQL to query
for data, or organize a pandas DataFrame.
4. Exploratory data analysis. (See checkpoint 2.)
5. Primary analysis. Based on the results of your exploration, choose a machine
learning technique (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, etc.) that will help you
answer the questions you posed in the introduction. Explain your reasoning.
6. Visualization. Explain the results and insights of your primary analysis with at least
one plot. Make sure that every element of the plots are labeled and explained (donâ€™t
forget to include a legend!).
7. Insights and Conclusions. After reading through the project, does an uninformed
reader feel informed about the topic? Would a reader who already knew about the
topic feel like they learned more about it?
If needed, you may add subsections.
